# IPL 2024 Insights

## Objective of the Project
To assist "Sports Basics," a newly established sports blog company, in increasing website traffic through a special edition magazine on IPL 2024.

## About the Project
Leveraging data from the past three IPL seasons, I've created an interactive dashboard that offers fans, analysts, and teams unique insights into batting, bowling, and team performances.

## Analysis for Insights
### Primary Analysis
- Identification of top 10 batsmen and bowlers based on runs scored, batting average, total wickets taken, and bowling average.
- Analysis of players with the highest strike rates and dot ball percentages.
- Evaluation of teams with the best winning percentages and those most successful in chasing targets.
### Secondary Analysis
- Prediction of Orange and Purple Cap winners for the 2024 season.
- Determination of the top 4 qualifying teams.
- Forecasting the winner and runner-up of the season.
- Selection of the Best 11 players and top 3 all-rounders based on performance data and additional research.

## Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Technique
- Importing CSV Files into Power BI:
  - dim_match_summary
  - fact_batting_summary
  - fact_bowling_summary
  - dim_players
- Data Transformation in Power Query:
  - Checking and changing data types for accuracy.
  - Converting overs to balls for consistency.
  - Standardizing column names and addressing missing values.

## Measures and Calculated Columns
